# A-Simple-Deep-Learning-Model-Using-Numeric-Dataset
This project contains a deep learning model for numeric dataset developed using  a separate CSV file

CSV Template:

Height	Weight	Gender

50	55	0

55	60	0

60	65	1

48	53	1

62	67	0

72	77	1

42	47	0

The project will read above dataset (already uploaded) as a CSV file. This is a simple project it will pick first 5 instances for training and last 2 instances for testing.
Then report the accuracy of the system
At the end of the project I also added the code to store and load model to the "Google Drive"
